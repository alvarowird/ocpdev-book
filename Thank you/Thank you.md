# Thank you
I started writing **Automated Application Packaging and Distribution with OpenShift** back in January 2021 originally, because I just wanted to have some notes for my day to day work. Then I realized that there are tons of things out there which need to be explained. People in my classes were telling me that they are overwhelmed with all the news around Kubernetes and OpenShift, so I decided to not only talk about it, but also write and blog about it. 

The positive feedback I got from readers around the world motivated me a lot to continue writing just another chapter. I wasnâ€™t aware that I am able to write so much on a development topic.

Thanks a lot for this. Thanks for reading. And thanks a lot for all your feedback.
